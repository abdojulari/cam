          These terms are an agreement between Edmonton Public Library (“EPL”) and you. 
          You should read all the terms before indicating acceptance. These terms apply to 
          membership for Library services, borrowing services, access to online content and 
          programs, Internet access, rules of conduct within a library branch, and use of 
          your Library account.

        <h6 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold my-3"> Accuracy of Membership Information</h6>
        <p>
          When you register for an EPL account, you attest that the personal information you 
          have provided is correct and current, and that you will notify EPL in a timely manner 
          if there are any changes to your contact details in the future. You will need to verify 
          your identity when you visit an EPL branch for the first time. Bring picture ID and proof 
          of address to any EPL branch to begin borrowing and to extend your 45-day temporary library 
          card to a full membership.

          Children under the age of 18 and others lacking in capacity require the consent of a parent 
          or guardian.  EPL will communicate with accounts that have a parent/guardian attached using 
          the email/phone/address provided for the account. No changes can be made to the account without 
          the parent/guardian’s consent.

        <h6 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold my-3"> Borrowing Rules</h6>
        <p>
          You accept full responsibility for the choice of library resources borrowed or accessed with 
          your library card, including on any library card where you are listed as the parent/guardian. 
          This includes being aware of the due dates applicable to the materials borrowed and accepting 
          financial responsibility for any fees incurred if materials are not returned or are returned 
          damaged to the EPL. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While EPL may, as a courtesy, send reminders about the due dates of borrowed materials, 
          you accept financial responsibility for all fees associated with unreturned or damaged items, 
          even if courtesy reminders have not reached you.
